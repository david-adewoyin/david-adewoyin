 ### Hi I'm David :wave:

 
I am Software Developer.
I love to learn and share my knowledge with other people.In my free time i read books, mostly ebooks produced by the folks at [Standard Ebooks]('https://standardebooks.org/'). I have a lot of stuff i have done ranging from mobile applications built using flutter to backends and data science and machine learning projects.


### Some of the things i have done :heart:  


 ### Data Science & Machine Learning:  

- [Car Price Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/Car_Price_Analysis_and_Prediction): Collected and analysed regional car price data using Python. Machine learning models for predicting car prices were developed and deployed using Flask.
- [Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis and Success Prediction](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/bank_marketing_success_prediction): Developed machine learning models for correctly classifying the success of a bank marketing campaign with indepth data exploration and visualization using Python and Tableau. 
- [Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/machine_learning_basics): Implemented  popular machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, softmax regression, K nearest neighbor, decision trees, bagging, random forest, etc from scratch using only plain Python and Numpy.
- [HackerNews Project](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/HackerNews): Using the official API, I scraped over 1.2 million posts and 70k+ usernames to perform EDA and entity recognition on data.
- [Apple Podcast Project](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/apple_podcasts): Scraped and published podcast metadata and user reviews dataset for machine learning projects.Â 


### Deep Learning
- [NeuralStyleTransfer](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/NeuralStyleTransfer): Developed Tensorflow Implementation of A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.
- [U-Net Image Segementation](https://github.com/david-adewoyin/UNet): Developed Tensorflow Implementation of the U-Net image segmentation architecture as described in the original paper.
